Overview
--------

We believe that the full potential of `theranostics`_ has not yet been achieved. There is still much to be done to improve the accuracy and efficiency of radiopharmaceutical therapies. We see a future where theranostics is personalized and precise, where patients receive the right treatment at the right time. To help us get there, we've developed Pytheranostics. 

Pytheranostics is a Python package that provides a comprehensive set of tools for theranostics research. It is designed to be user-friendly, efficient, and flexible, allowing you to perform a wide range of tasks with ease.
Whether you're a beginner or an advanced user, you'll find something useful in our comprehensive documentation.
